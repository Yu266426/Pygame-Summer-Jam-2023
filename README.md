# CiliAdventure

Pronouced like "silly adventure", because Cili like Ciliate, you know? I'm too funny...

Anyways, if that title didn't give it away, you're a small ciliate in a micro world trying to survive mazes of cyanobacteria and mine fields of heliozoa, while rotifers are trying to suck you in.
Hope you have fun playing the game!

Everything (including art and music) is made by me, with the exception of the font, which is from Mozilla: https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/.

## Running the source
If you intend on running the source code, you'll need my engine: https://github.com/Yu266426/pygbase. 
You can install it by doing `pip install .` inside of the directory.
